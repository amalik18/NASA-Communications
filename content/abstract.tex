NASA's CubeSat Laser Infrared CrosslinK (CLICK) is a missions to demonstrate the capabilities of optical communications for small spacecrafts (smallsats). The mission, itself, is split in to phases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CLICK-A:} a risk mitigation mission to test elements of the optical communications systems \cite{click_1}
    \item \textbf{CLICK-B/C:} a mission to demonstrate full-duplex optical communication between two 3U smallsats \cite{click_1}
\end{itemize}
CLICK-A was launched as a part of SpaceX's Commercial Resupply Service (CRS-25) mission, which was a part of the Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) mission.
The mission's goals are two-fold: it aims to demonstrate the one-way optical communications via a downlink and to show the feasibility and usability of the laser in a two spacecraft full-duplex scenario.
CLICK-A, a 3-unit (3U) spacecraft, will demonstrate the precision pointing performance for the fine steering mirror control system which, in turn, enables the use
of lower power lasers in CLICK-B/C \cite{caldwell_nasa-supported_2022}.
