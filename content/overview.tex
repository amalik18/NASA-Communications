As mentioned before, the CLICK mission is a mission which will demonstrate the technology needs for low size, weight, and power (SWaP) communication terminals for down and crosslinks. The mission itself is split in two phases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phase 1 - CLICK-A}: A mission that consists of a single 3U CubeSat with a downlink terminal hosted on it \cite{click_a}.
    \item \textbf{Phase 2 - CLICK-B/C}: A mission that consists of two 3U CubeSats each with their own crosslink terminals on-board.\cite{click_a}
\end{itemize}

Together these two missions will prove a nanosatellite laser communications terminals system with downlinks from low-Earth orbit (LEO) altitudes of 400-600 \unit{\kilo\meter} to a portable ground station, additionally, it will also provide crosslinks over ranges of 25-580 \unit{\kilo \meter} \cite{optical}.
